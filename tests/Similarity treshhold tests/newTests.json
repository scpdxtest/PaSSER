    "question": " What are the three primary production factors in agriculture that significantly contribute to greenhouse gas GHG emissions and how do each factors impacts on GHH emissions differ i In what ways does converting land for cultivation result in increased CO2 emissions ii How does the production of fertilizers contribute to both CO2 and nitrous oxide emissions and iii What role do livestock play in agricultures methane and nitrous oxide emissions",
    "answer": "Increasing efficiency in the use of resources is also one of the driving principles of CSA. GHG emissions from agriculture are linked to its use of resources. Three production factors have an important influence on total agricultural GHG emissions: (i) area, since converting land into cultivations would require either deforestation or grasslands being converted to croplands, which would induce higher CO2 emissions; (ii) fertilizers, whose production is an important source of CO2 and which at the field level translate into nitrous oxide emissions; and (iii) livestock, which is an important source of methane and nitrous oxide emissions.\r"

    "question": " What was the primary contributor to the over 160 percent increase in global crop production between 1961 and 2005 and how did this contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions compared to expanding cultivated land based on 1961 yields",
    "answer": "Studies show that, at the global level, from 1961 to 2005, crop production increased by over 160 percent, mostly as a result of 135 percent yield increases, with only 27 percent increases in crop area. This intensification allowed farmers to increase food production while emitting the equivalent of 590 gigatons of CO2 less than what would have been emitted by expanding the area under cultivation on the basis of assuming 1961 yields. They conclude that land use change emissions (even avoided ones) are much more important than direct emissions from agricultural systems. Therefore, improvement of crop yields should be prominent in any mitigation strategy.\r"

    "question": " What measures can be taken to enhance fertilizer efficiency and reduce economic costs and emissions from synthetic fertilizers during crop production How can nutrient application be optimized to align more closely with plant requirements throughout the growing season and what techniques could be employed for this purpose Additionally what methods may be utilized to place nutrients nearer to plant roots such as deep placement of specific fertilizers for rice",
    "answer": "Nutrients are essential to increase yields. But production of synthetic fertilizers is energy intensive, with high CO2 emissions and economic costs. In addition, when applied in the field, these fertilizers contribute to N2O emissions. Therefore, there is a need to improve fertilization and to limit the economic costs and the emissions at the same time. Improving fertilizer efficiency is thus essential. This can be done through a variety of techniques. One way is to match more precisely the nutrients with plant needs during the growing season, such as by fractioning the total amount in multiple doses. Other techniques include precision farming and placing nutrients closer to plant roots, such as deep placement of urea for rice.\r"

    "question": " What specific method developed by the International Fertilizer Development Center IFDC results in a 40 reduction of nitrogen losses and a 50 increase in urea efficiency for rice systems compared to traditional broadcast application techniques This technique involves making urea into briquettes and placing them at what depth after paddy transplantation",
    "answer": "Urea Deep Placement (UDP) technique, developed by the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), is a good example of a climate-smart solution for rice systems. The usual technique for applying urea, the main nitrogen fertilizer for rice, is through a broadcast application. This is a very inefficient practice, with 60 to 70 percent nitrogen losses contributing to GHG emissions and water pollution. In the UDP technique, urea is made into 'briquettes' of 1 to 3 grams that are placed at 7 to 10 cm soil depth after the paddy is transplanted. This technique decreases nitrogen losses by 40 percent and increases urea efficiency to 50 percent. It increases yields by 25 percent with an average 25 percent decrease in urea use.\r"

    "question": " How can farmers implement sustainable crop production intensification SCPI methods specifically referring to techniques for conserving and enhancing natural resources and applying appropriate external inputs to resilient crop varieties",
    "answer": "Sustainable crop production intensification (SCPI) can be summed up in the words 'Save and Grow'. Sustainable intensification means a productive agriculture that conserves and enhances natural resources. It uses an ecosystem approach that draws on nature’s contribution to crop growth – soil organic matter, water flow regulation, pollination and natural predation of pests. It applies appropriate external inputs at the right time, in the right amount to improved crop varieties that are resilient to climate change. It also uses nutrients, water and external inputs more efficiently.\r"

    "question": " How can farmers enhance sustainable crop production while reducing resource waste and fossil fuel consumption What are some common inefficiencies in fertilizer use and what consequences can arise from these inefficiencies including contamination of water sources In what instances does inappropriate insecticide usage lead to pest outbreaks and how can overuse of herbicides contribute to the development of weed varieties resistant to herbicides What management practices if improperly implemented could result in soil health issues like salinization or reduced soil quality",
    "answer": "Increasing the sustainable intensification of crop production is achievable. This can be done through increasing resource use efficiency and cutting the use of fossil fuels. This saves money for farmers and prevents the negative effect of over-use of particular inputs. Inefficient fertilizer use is common in many regions. In some cases, this is a consequence of government subsidies. Yet over-use does not have the intended impact on plant growth and can result in the contamination of ground and surface water. Inappropriate insecticide use may actually induce pest outbreaks by disrupting the natural population of predators. Overuse of herbicides can lead to the emergence of herbicide-tolerant varieties of weeds. Problems of salinization or reduced soil health may also come from inappropriate management practices, such as irrigating without proper drainage.\r"

    "answer": "Better maintenance of ecosystem services can be accomplished through: adopting agricultural practices that are based on crop rotations, applying minimum tillage and maintaining soil cover; relying on natural processes of predation or biocontrol of pest or weed problems; managing pollination services; selecting diverse and appropriate varieties; and carefully targeting the use of external inputs. These practices are knowledge-intensive and they are often also interdependent. In the initial stages, encouraging these practices may require public support through targeted incentives and investment. Ideally, the price of agricultural commodities would increasingly reflect the full cost of production, including the potential damage done to natural ecosystems, thereby encouraging more sustainable consumption.\r"

    "question": " How can farmers and policymakers prepare for the unpredictable effects of climate change on agriculture given the limitations in accurately modeling and projecting these changes at a local scale What measures can be taken to increase the resilience and reduce vulnerability of agricultural systems to climaterelated risks and uncertainties",
    "answer": "Climate change will profoundly affect, in any given place, the conditions under which agricultural activities are undertaken. It will affect existing risks and add new risks and uncertainties. As pointed out by the High-Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition (HLPE, 2012a), models cannot project climate change effects precisely, neither in time nor at the local scale needed for decision makers. Moreover, climate models do not deal with the consequences of increased variability, the impacts of stress combinations, the effects of climate change on whole agro-ecosystems, including crops, their pests and predators of these pests. As it is impossible to predict exactly these changes, it is often difficult to devise and promote precise adaptation measures. One of the most effective approaches to be prepared for uncertainty and new risks – a ‘no regret’ approach that is valid whatever changes happen – is to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience of a given system (FAO and OECD, 2012; HLPE, 2012a). \r"

    "answer": "Systems can be defined at various scales. An upper-scale system is generally composed of different systems defined at lower scales. For instance, from a biophysical perspective, landscape systems are composed of farm systems. The vulnerability of an upper-scale system depends on the vulnerability of the subsystems that it includes. It also depends on how other systems to which it is linked, including higher-scale systems, are vulnerable or insensitive to shocks. For example, the vulnerability of a farm to a certain risk is compounded by its own vulnerability and the vulnerability of the landscape in which it is situated, and whose vulnerability is in turn compounded by the vulnerabilities of the various farms situated in it and by the vulnerability of the higher-level system (e.g. the territory) in which it is situated.\r"

    "answer": "Resilience can be described as the capacity of systems, communities, households or individuals to prevent, mitigate or cope with risk and recover from shocks. At first approximation, resilience is the opposite of vulnerability. However, resilience adds a time dimension. A system is resilient when it is less vulnerable to shocks across time and can recover from them. Essential to resilience is adaptive capacity. Adaptive capacity encompasses two dimensions: recovery from shocks and response to changes in order to ensure the ‘plasticity’ of the system.\r"

    "answer": "And as for vulnerability, resilience can be considered in various dimensions (biophysical, economic and social) and at various scales. The way the various dimensions and scales interact is crucial, precisely because of the importance of general resilience for coping with uncertainty. For instance, studies show that increasing the level of education of farmers can be an efficient mean for reducing farmers’ household vulnerability to climate change.\r"

    "question": " What is the maximum level of adaptation a system can undergo before undergoing a fundamental transformation into a new type of system Regarding the concept of resilience and its focus on longterm capacity to recover transform and adapt to a dynamic environment",
    "answer": "Resilience puts a greater emphasis on the capacity of a system to recover and transform itself over the long term, and adapt to its changing environment in a dynamic perspective. It implies that it is not only shocks, as a change relative to an average, that have to be considered, but also the change of the average itself. Ultimately, the question is until what point can a system adapt before changing to another type of system?\r"

  {
    "question": " How can reducing exposure and sensitivity as well as increasing adaptive capacity for various types of risks contribute to enhancing resilience in both the biophysical and economic and social domains In what ways can transmission of shocks between different types of risks scales and domains be minimized and how can compensation mechanisms be organized between scales or domains to mitigate cumulative and longterm effects",
    "answer": "To a great extent increasing resilience can be achieved by reducing vulnerabilities and increasing adaptive capacity. This can be done by reducing exposure to risk, reducing sensitivity and increasing adaptive capacity for every type of risk. It can act in each domain, either biophysical or economic and social. One way to achieve better resilience is to reduce transmission of shocks between types of risks, between scales and between domains and to organize compensation between scales (for instance transport of feed) or between domains (for instance safety nets) to avoid cumulative and long-term effects.\r"

  {
    "question": " What are three methods for building resilience in agricultural systems against various shocks and how can each method specifically reduce the impact of both climatic and nonclimatic risks1 How can farmers reduce their exposure to both climatic and nonclimatic shocks by minimizing their source or limiting their extent Provide an example of a successful implementation of this method in reducing a major risk for livestock2 In what ways can farmers make their systems less sensitive to drought and which crop varieties and stock management practices are effective in achieving this reduction in sensitivity3 Explain how increasing adaptive capacity works in agricultural systems and provide an example of how considering potential shocks and changes together can help farmers prepare for compensating cumulative or exacerbating effects",
    "answer": "In a first approximation we can identify the following three ways to build resilience: 1. Reduce exposure. There is a fundamental difference between climatic and non-climatic shocks in this regard because most of the shocks on farm can be reduced at the source, or limited in their extension, contrary to climatic shocks. The best example of a non-climatic shock is probably the eradication of Rinderpest, which has totally suppressed a major risk for livestock and those depending on it. 2. Reduce the sensitivity of systems to shocks. Using drought-resistant varieties or keeping adequate stocks of hay can for instance, reduce sensitivity to drought. 3.Increase adaptive capacity. This includes considering the modifications of a system and taking into account all the potential shocks and changes together (to take into account compensating, cumulative or exacerbating effects). \r"

    "question": " What is the required land area for a family to sustain themselves with a diverse diet using the agroforestry system compared to the traditional slashandburn system in terms of hectares and exploitation duration How does the efficiency of land use labor productivity capital productivity and yield stability differ between the two systems Additionally how do organic matter in the soil and nutrient utilization by plants impact the reduction of fertilizer costs in agroforestry systems At the community level how does the diversification of production affect local market development",
    "answer": "In traditional slash-and-burn systems, a family needs close to 6 hectares to maintain itself on a diet of corn and beans. The family exploits a plot for two years and then sets it aside for 14 years. In agroforestry systems a plot is exploited for 10 years, producing, along with corn and beans a variety of other products, often including livestock. The plot is then set aside for only 5 years. A family thus needs 1.4 hectares to sustain itself and enjoy a more diverse and balanced diet. Land is therefore almost 4 times more efficient. Efficiency also increases because in agroforestry systems, yields (which are comparable the first year) do not decline over time as they do very rapidly in slash-and-burn systems. In fact, yields can even increase slightly over time in agroforestry systems. Productivity of labour and of capital is also higher in agroforestry systems. Costs are reduced, especially for fertilizers, because of more organic matter in the soil and better use of nutrients by the plants. At the community level, diversification of production triggers the development of local markets. Consequently, in terms of resource use, agroforestry systems are efficient at safeguarding food security and the environment.\r"

    "question": " What are the advantages of implementing agroforestry systems over traditional monoculture farming methods specifically in terms of yield stability production diversity income diversification and soil protection Furthermore according to studies how does the implementation of agroforestry systems impact erosion reduction",
    "answer": "Agroforestry systems are also much more resilient: Yields are less variable, because of better humidity retention. They provide for more diverse production, which ensures in turn a buffer against both the variability of crop yields and price volatility. They offer diversified sources of income, including through selling wood for various uses (and at various time scales), which can also provide a buffer against some economic shocks. They protect the soil from erosion, which is a major concern in these areas. Studies have shown that in agroforestry systems erosion is reduced by a factor of more than 10.\r"

    "question": " How does enhancing the sustainability of forest management lead to increased resilience in forests and contributing factors such as water management soil protection and agrobiodiversity conservation for farming systems",
    "answer": "The notion of resilience is particularly powerful for bringing together interventions that cover different dimensions. Improving the sustainability of forest management not only increases the forest’s resilience, but also contributes to improving water management, protecting the soil from erosion and to conserving agrobiodiversity (e.g. by providing habitat to pollinators). In this way, improvements in the sustainability of forest management contribute to improving the resilience of farming systems.\r"

    "question": " How can the simultaneous pursuit of efficiency and resilience in various agricultural systems and food chains help mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure longterm food security What are some examples of how increasing efficiency could impact resilience such as in livestock production or importing countries food security Additionally which strategies such as increasing soil carbon stocks enhancing diversity in the field and improving trade are particularly effective in improving both efficiency and resilience within food systems",
    "answer": "Efficiency and resilience should be pursued together and at various scales in different agricultural systems and food chains. Being efficient without being resilient will not be helpful over the long term, given that shocks will occur more often due to climate change. Being resilient without being efficient or without allowing for an increase in production, will pose problems for ensuring food security over the long term and for supporting livelihoods. In the pursuit of these two goals, there might be trade-offs, but there will also be synergies. Increasing efficiency could lead to greater sensitivity to certain shocks. For example, more productive livestock is more sensitive to heat waves (Hoffmann, 2010). On the other hand, increased efficiency can be a factor in increasing resilience. For example, increasing production in food importing countries will improve their resilience to price volatility. Increasing soil carbon stocks, enhancing diversity in the field and improving trade are of particular interest with regard to improving efficiency and resilience of food systems.\r"

  {
    "question": " How does the enhancement of soil organic carbon contribute to the productivity and adaptability of agricultural land specifically in terms of nutrient and water absorption by plants reduction of erosion and improvement of water retention and contribution to climate change mitigation",
    "answer": "Increasing soil organic carbon improves both efficiency and resilience. It improves nutrient and water intake by plants, which increases yields and resource efficiency of land, nutrients and water. It also reduces soil erosion and increases water retention, especially as it is often combined with added soil cover, as in conservation agriculture. This combination makes the system more resilient to variability of precipitation and to extreme events. Increasing carbon sinks in the soils also captures carbon, which contributes to climate change mitigation.\r"

Consumption patterns play an important role in the increased demand on agriculture, on the impact of food systems on environment and also on food security. More sustainable patterns of consumption would, in particular, play an essential role to mitigate climate change (HLPE 2012a). Sustainable diets are defined by FAO as “those diets with low environmental impacts that contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy lives for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable, nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy, while optimizing natural and human resources” (FAO, 2010d). But, to a great extent the tools, policies and institutions that could influence consumption and diets, especially in developed countries, are very different from those that would be used to transform agricultural systems.
