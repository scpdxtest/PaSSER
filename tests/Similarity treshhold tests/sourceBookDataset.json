    "question": " How does the agricultural and food system contribute to food security beyond just providing physical products What role do income and employment generated from agriculture play in this context",
    "answer": "Agriculture and food systems not only utilize a very diverse range of resources but also produce a very diverse range of outputs. They provide physical products but also income and employment, for farmers, in agro-industry and as a driver of the non-farm rural economy. From a food security perspective, these three outputs are equally important. It implies a more complex conception of resource efficiency, by which employment, which is formally an input in pure economic terms, can be seen as a key output.\r"

    "question": " What are the three primary production factors in agriculture that significantly contribute to greenhouse gas GHG emissions and how do each factors impacts on GHH emissions differ i In what ways does converting land for cultivation result in increased CO2 emissions ii How does the production of fertilizers contribute to both CO2 and nitrous oxide emissions and iii What role do livestock play in agricultures methane and nitrous oxide emissions",
    "answer": "Increasing efficiency in the use of resources is also one of the driving principles of CSA. GHG emissions from agriculture are linked to its use of resources. Three production factors have an important influence on total agricultural GHG emissions: (i) area, since converting land into cultivations would require either deforestation or grasslands being converted to croplands, which would induce higher CO2 emissions; (ii) fertilizers, whose production is an important source of CO2 and which at the field level translate into nitrous oxide emissions; and (iii) livestock, which is an important source of methane and nitrous oxide emissions.\r"

    "question": " What was the primary contributor to the over 160 percent increase in global crop production between 1961 and 2005 and how did this contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions compared to expanding cultivated land based on 1961 yields",
    "answer": "Studies show that, at the global level, from 1961 to 2005, crop production increased by over 160 percent, mostly as a result of 135 percent yield increases, with only 27 percent increases in crop area. This intensification allowed farmers to increase food production while emitting the equivalent of 590 gigatons of CO2 less than what would have been emitted by expanding the area under cultivation on the basis of assuming 1961 yields. They conclude that land use change emissions (even avoided ones) are much more important than direct emissions from agricultural systems.

    "question": " What is the significance of the yield gap in developing countries and how can bridging the difference between actual and potential yields contribute to enhancing food security and preventing deforestation",
    "answer": "Studies have shown the importance in many developing countries of the yield gap. The yield gap is the difference between actual farm yields, as represented by the average yield achieved by farmers in a defined region over several seasons, and the potential yields which are the maximum achievable yield with latest varieties and by removing as much as possible all the constraints as achieved in highly controlled experimental stations. Reducing this gap is essential to improve food security and reduce deforestation.\r"

    "question": " What measures can be taken to enhance fertilizer efficiency and reduce economic costs and emissions from synthetic fertilizers during crop production How can nutrient application be optimized to align more closely with plant requirements throughout the growing season and what techniques could be employed for this purpose Additionally what methods may be utilized to place nutrients nearer to plant roots such as deep placement of specific fertilizers for rice",
    "answer": "Nutrients are essential to increase yields. But production of synthetic fertilizers is energy intensive, with high CO2 emissions and economic costs. In addition, when applied in the field, these fertilizers contribute to N2O emissions. Therefore, there is a need to improve fertilization and to limit the economic costs and the emissions at the same time. Improving fertilizer efficiency is thus essential. This can be done through a variety of techniques. One way is to match more precisely the nutrients with plant needs during the growing season, such as by fractioning the total amount in multiple doses. Other techniques include precision farming and placing nutrients closer to plant roots, such as deep placement of urea for rice.\r"

    "answer": "Urea Deep Placement (UDP) technique, developed by the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), is a good example of a climate-smart solution for rice systems. The usual technique for applying urea, the main nitrogen fertilizer for rice, is through a broadcast application. This is a very inefficient practice, with 60 to 70 percent nitrogen losses contributing to GHG emissions and water pollution. In the UDP technique, urea is made into 'briquettes' of 1 to 3 grams that are placed at 7 to 10 cm soil depth after the paddy is transplanted. This technique decreases nitrogen losses by 40 percent and increases urea efficiency to 50 percent. It increases yields by 25 percent with an average 25 percent decrease in urea use.\r"

    "answer": "Sustainable crop production intensification (SCPI) can be summed up in the words 'Save and Grow'. Sustainable intensification means a productive agriculture that conserves and enhances natural resources. It uses an ecosystem approach that draws on nature’s contribution to crop growth – soil organic matter, water flow regulation, pollination and natural predation of pests. It applies appropriate external inputs at the right time, in the right amount to improved crop varieties that are resilient to climate change. It also uses nutrients, water and external inputs more efficiently.\r"

    "answer": "Increasing the sustainable intensification of crop production is achievable. This can be done through increasing resource use efficiency and cutting the use of fossil fuels. This saves money for farmers and prevents the negative effect of over-use of particular inputs. Inefficient fertilizer use is common in many regions. In some cases, this is a consequence of government subsidies. Yet over-use does not have the intended impact on plant growth and can result in the contamination of ground and surface water. Inappropriate insecticide use may actually induce pest outbreaks by disrupting the natural population of predators. Overuse of herbicides can lead to the emergence of herbicide-tolerant varieties of weeds. Problems of salinization or reduced soil health may also come from inappropriate management practices, such as irrigating without proper drainage.\r"

    "answer": "Better maintenance of ecosystem services can be accomplished through: adopting agricultural practices that are based on crop rotations, applying minimum tillage and maintaining soil cover; relying on natural processes of predation or biocontrol of pest or weed problems; managing pollination services; selecting diverse and appropriate varieties; and carefully targeting the use of external inputs. These practices are knowledge-intensive and they are often also interdependent. In the initial stages, encouraging these practices may require public support through targeted incentives and investment. Ideally, the price of agricultural commodities would increasingly reflect the full cost of production, including the potential damage done to natural ecosystems, thereby encouraging more sustainable consumption.\r"

    "question": " How can farmers and policymakers prepare for the unpredictable effects of climate change on agriculture given the limitations in accurately modeling and projecting these changes at a local scale What measures can be taken to increase the resilience and reduce vulnerability of agricultural systems to climaterelated risks and uncertainties",
    "answer": "Climate change will profoundly affect, in any given place, the conditions under which agricultural activities are undertaken. It will affect existing risks and add new risks and uncertainties. As pointed out by the High-Level Panel of Experts on Food Security and Nutrition (HLPE, 2012a), models cannot project climate change effects precisely, neither in time nor at the local scale needed for decision makers. Moreover, climate models do not deal with the consequences of increased variability, the impacts of stress combinations, the effects of climate change on whole agro-ecosystems, including crops, their pests and predators of these pests. As it is impossible to predict exactly these changes, it is often difficult to devise and promote precise adaptation measures. One of the most effective approaches to be prepared for uncertainty and new risks – a ‘no regret’ approach that is valid whatever changes happen – is to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience of a given system (FAO and OECD, 2012; HLPE, 2012a). \r"

For instance, from a biophysical perspective, landscape systems are composed of farm systems. The vulnerability of an upper-scale system depends on the vulnerability of the subsystems that it includes. It also depends on how other systems to which it is linked, including higher-scale systems, are vulnerable or insensitive to shocks. For example, the vulnerability of a farm to a certain risk is compounded by its own vulnerability and the vulnerability of the landscape in which it is situated, and whose vulnerability is in turn compounded by the vulnerabilities of the various farms situated in it and by the vulnerability of the higher-level system (e.g. the territory) in which it is situated.\r"

There is a fundamental difference between climatic and non-climatic shocks in this regard because most of the shocks on farm can be reduced at the source, or limited in their extension, contrary to climatic shocks. The best example of a non-climatic shock is probably the eradication of Rinderpest, which has totally suppressed a major risk for livestock and those depending on it. 2.

A family thus needs 1.4 hectares to sustain itself and enjoy a more diverse and balanced diet. Land is therefore almost 4 times more efficient. Efficiency also increases because in agroforestry systems, yields (which are comparable the first year) do not decline over time as they do very rapidly in slash-and-burn systems. In fact, yields can even increase slightly over time in agroforestry systems. Productivity of labour and of capital is also higher in agroforestry systems. Costs are reduced, especially for fertilizers, because of more organic matter in the soil and better use of nutrients by the plants. At the community level, diversification of production triggers the development of local markets. Consequently, in terms of resource use, agroforestry systems are efficient at safeguarding food security and the environment.\r"

    "question": " What are the advantages of implementing agroforestry systems over traditional monoculture farming methods specifically in terms of yield stability production diversity income diversification and soil protection Furthermore according to studies how does the implementation of agroforestry systems impact erosion reduction",
    "answer": "Agroforestry systems are also much more resilient: Yields are less variable, because of better humidity retention. They provide for more diverse production, which ensures in turn a buffer against both the variability of crop yields and price volatility. They offer diversified sources of income, including through selling wood for various uses (and at various time scales), which can also provide a buffer against some economic shocks. They protect the soil from erosion, which is a major concern in these areas. Studies have shown that in agroforestry systems erosion is reduced by a factor of more than 10.\r"

    "question": " How does enhancing the sustainability of forest management lead to increased resilience in forests and contributing factors such as water management soil protection and agrobiodiversity conservation for farming systems",
    "answer": "The notion of resilience is particularly powerful for bringing together interventions that cover different dimensions. Improving the sustainability of forest management not only increases the forest’s resilience, but also contributes to improving water management, protecting the soil from erosion and to conserving agrobiodiversity (e.g. by providing habitat to pollinators). In this way, improvements in the sustainability of forest management contribute to improving the resilience of farming systems.\r"

    "question": " How can the simultaneous pursuit of efficiency and resilience in various agricultural systems and food chains help mitigate the effects of climate change and ensure longterm food security What are some examples of how increasing efficiency could impact resilience such as in livestock production or importing countries food security Additionally which strategies such as increasing soil carbon stocks enhancing diversity in the field and improving trade are particularly effective in improving both efficiency and resilience within food systems",
    "answer": "Efficiency and resilience should be pursued together and at various scales in different agricultural systems and food chains. Being efficient without being resilient will not be helpful over the long term, given that shocks will occur more often due to climate change. Being resilient without being efficient or without allowing for an increase in production, will pose problems for ensuring food security over the long term and for supporting livelihoods. In the pursuit of these two goals, there might be trade-offs, but there will also be synergies. Increasing efficiency could lead to greater sensitivity to certain shocks. For example, more productive livestock is more sensitive to heat waves (Hoffmann, 2010). On the other hand, increased efficiency can be a factor in increasing resilience. For example, increasing production in food importing countries will improve their resilience to price volatility. Increasing soil carbon stocks, enhancing diversity in the field and improving trade are of particular interest with regard to improving efficiency and resilience of food systems.\r"

  {
    "question": " How does the enhancement of soil organic carbon contribute to the productivity and adaptability of agricultural land specifically in terms of nutrient and water absorption by plants reduction of erosion and improvement of water retention and contribution to climate change mitigation",
    "answer": "Increasing soil organic carbon improves both efficiency and resilience. It improves nutrient and water intake by plants, which increases yields and resource efficiency of land, nutrients and water. It also reduces soil erosion and increases water retention, especially as it is often combined with added soil cover, as in conservation agriculture. This combination makes the system more resilient to variability of precipitation and to extreme events. Increasing carbon sinks in the soils also captures carbon, which contributes to climate change mitigation.\r"

    "answer": "Changes in farming systems should be accompanied by changes all along food chains. For instance, as pointed out by the HLPE increasing diversity in the field often requires changes in consumption patterns. In fact, diversification often requires changes along the entire food chain, from input production and distribution to collection, transformation and commercialization of products. For these reasons, diversification is often more easily carried out as a collective project.

The concept recognized the value of the environment, extended the time horizon and emphasized the role of equity. The Brundtland Commission noted that sustainable development embodies two key themes: The idea of “needs”, in particular the essential needs of the world’s poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and The idea of “limitations” imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment’s ability to meet present and future needs.\r"

Consumption patterns play an important role in the increased demand on agriculture, on the impact of food systems on environment and also on food security. More sustainable patterns of consumption would, in particular, play an essential role to mitigate climate change (HLPE 2012a). Sustainable diets are defined by FAO as “those diets with low environmental impacts that contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy lives for present and future generations. Sustainable diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems, culturally acceptable, accessible, economically fair and affordable, nutritionally adequate, safe and healthy, while optimizing natural and human resources” (FAO, 2010d). But, to a great extent the tools, policies and institutions that could influence consumption and diets, especially in developed countries, are very different from those that would be used to transform agricultural systems.

    "answer": "Large-scale environmental degradation is not inevitable and can be reversed (Bai et al., 2008). The Global Assessment of Land Degradation and Improvement (FAO and ISRIC, 2008) established that while land degradation was still spreading between 1991 and 2008, the trend was not clear cut. There are areas where land quality has been declining (24 percent of the global land surface), but also areas where land quality has improved (16 percent) (Steenbergen et al., 2011). The reversal from degradation to sustainable production has in some cases been very rapid, taking only a matter of years. In many cases, these reversals have been made in areas where populations have increased. There are many examples that illustrate that it is possible to realize the scenario: ‘more people, more trees, more livestock, more water, better lives and better economies’ (e.g. see Critchley, 2010 and Box 2.1). \r"

    "answer": "To improve water availability and soil fertility in Burkina Faso’s Central Plateau, farmers have sown crops in planting pits and built stone contour bunds. In southern Niger, farmers have developed innovative ways of regenerating and multiplying valuable trees. These lands now support increasing amounts of trees, crops, and livestock, which has enhanced the food security of about 3 million people. Water levels in wells has increased significantly, and some farmers can maintain small vegetable gardens near the wells, which adds to their incomes and improves nutrition. Although millet and sorghum remain the dominant crops, farmers working on rehabilitated land are also growing cowpea and sesame. With increased quantities of fodder and crop residues, farmers can keep livestock closer to their fields in more intensive and profitable livestock production systems. The manure can then be used as fertilizer to improve soil fertility. These innovations have also greatly improved the supply of fuelwood over the past 20 to 30 years, allowing women to reallocate the time once spent on collecting fuelwood to other activities.\r"

    "answer": "Ecosystem services are generally classified according to the benefits that they deliver: provisioning services (e.g the provision of food, fiber, energy and water); regulating services (e.g. the regulation of pest and disease outbreaks, the cycling and purification of water or regulation of greenhouse gas [GHG] emissions and carbon sequestration); supporting services (e.g. pollination and nutrient recycling); and cultural services (MEA, 2005). The provisioning services depend upon a wide variety of supporting and regulatory services, such as soil fertility and pollination (MEA, 200) that determine the underlying biophysical capacity of agro-ecosystems. Biodiversity underpins all ecosystem services. A rich genetic base increases the likelihood that there will be species present in the system that have the traits necessary to fulfil different functional roles in the ecosystem and allow the continued delivery of ecosystem services in a changing climate (see also table 2.1 and more on genetic resources in Module 6).\r"

    "answer": "Sustainably increasing or intensifying productivity offers important opportunities for mitigating climate change by decreasing deforestation, rehabilitating eroded soils and reducing pressure on surrounding natural ecosystems. Similarly, holistic management of grassland ecosystems will help to regenerate degraded areas and improve vegetation cover. Grassland management can also be accompanied by the introduction of trees, which sequester carbon in the soils and biomass. Improved grazing management (management that increases production) can lead to an increase of soil carbon stocks (Conant, 2009) (more on livestock management in Module 8). If their biological processes are preserved, valuable ecosystems like wetlands and peatlands perform important water regulatory services and constitute a large carbon sink (see Box 2.4).

    "answer": "A participatory process can strengthen stakeholders’ sense of ownership of the objectives of landscape management and encourage them to engage in defined activities. However, engaging in a participatory process is often time consuming. Results may not be perceived immediately as processes of social change can take generations. It is therefore important that stakeholders involved in the process, especially those that do not live in the area, tolerate uncertainty and see landscape management as a long-term activitiy. However, landscape management also needs to achieve some short-term results that can provide stakeholders with incentives to continue the process.

    "answer": "Carrying out interrelated actions at different levels also means making trade-offs. Managing natural resources and community needs at a landscape level involves linking actions undertaken on smaller land units to land-use management at the broader landscape level. For example, there are trade-offs that may need to be made between increasing productivity and reducing GHG emissions, and between different land uses (e.g. harvesting nontimber products and logging in forests). Defining, evaluating and balancing different legitimate interests and objectives to create a common vision is central to integrated landscape management.

It is necessary to apply a planning framework that links these diverse planning processes (for example see Case Study 2.8 in section 2.3). If planning is made at the national or regional level without the involvement of local stakeholders, the chances that the implementation of planned activities will not be successful or sustainable increase. Conversely, activities planned at the landscape or community level that are not supported by enabling policies or governmental authorities may struggle to succeed due to a variety of factors, including, insufficient land tenure, poor infrastructure, and inadequate institutional and market structures.

The relative impacts of climate change will vary from one agricultural system to another, but it is important that adaptation strategies take into account the overall context in which they are to be implemented. \r"

    "question": " What is the anticipated difference in the rate of annual changes in runoff and recharge between those driven by climate change compared to human demands regarding their impact on water resources within a short to mediumterm perspective Is there existing evidence suggesting that variability and extreme events linked to climate change are currently affecting water resources more significantly than gradual changes",
    "answer": "Of particular relevance is the time frame for climate change and its relation to the speed of change driven by development. Annual changes in runoff and recharge due to climate change are expected to occur at a slower pace than changes caused by human demands for water. However, changes in variability and extreme events associated with climate change may already be having impacts and deserve particular attention for short- to medium-term responses.\r"

    "question": " How do climate change impacts on rainfall patterns and temperatures differently affect crop production in subtropics and semiarid tropics compared to mountainous regions or pastoral areas In which areas is there an increased risk for crop failures due to soil moisture variations extreme events or water availability changes",
    "answer": "The distinction between rainfed and irrigated production systems will dictate the impacts and associated risks related to climate change. Rainfed systems in sub-tropics and semi-arid tropics will be mostly affected by changes in rainfall patterns and temperatures. These changes will lead to greater frequency of crop failures as a result of increased variations in soil moisture. In mountainous areas, rainfed farming in marginal areas will also be affected by the impact of extreme events, including intense rainfalls, floods and erosion. Pastoral areas will suffer from more frequent drying of water points and greater variability in available animal feed.\r"

  {
    "question": " What impact does climate change have on the availability and management of water resources in irrigated systems that are already overexploited specifically in relation to droughts floods and annual runoff distribution",
    "answer": "Irrigated systems are better protected against rainfall variability. But these systems will increasingly require greater storage capacity to respond to more frequent droughts and floods and changes in the annual distribution of runoff. For surface or groundwater systems already being over-exploited, climate change will add an extra burden to water management and generally lead to a reduction in the availability of water and greater competition for water resources. \r"

    "question": " How might changes in precipitation patterns and freshwater availability impact the migrations and life history patterns of aquatic species particularly those reliant on rainfall and flood events for spawning and feeding Additionally how could climate change affect the suitability of environments for integrated irrigation systems used in aquaculture potentially necessitating modifications to system components or the introduction of different fish species Furthermore what role could increased storage play in the integration of fish farming through cage culture and enhancement of fisheries production",
    "answer": "Aquatic systems and capture fisheries will be affected by changes in quantity and quality of freshwater, which will have an impact on production. Many aquatic species depend on the timing of rainfall and flood events for important migrations (e.g. spawning and feeding). Changes in precipitation may disrupt these migrations or force these species to make adaptations in their life history patterns. Integrated irrigation systems (e.g. rice and fish) could see changes in system components as climate change alters the suitability of the environment, (e.g. more or less water may require different species of fish). Increased storage (i.e. more or larger reservoirs) could promote integration of fish farming through cage culture and enhance the fisheries production (see also Module 10 on fisheries and aquaculture). \r"

    "question": " What specific hydrological assessments require the application of a riskbased approach considering the significant uncertainties surrounding future runoff patterns due to climate change variability and different IPCC emission scenarios",
    "answer": "The current level of uncertainty associated with the impact of climate change on water availability remains high. The downscaling of global circulation models and local and regional assessments of precipitation patterns produce large variations in the assessment of runoff and aquifer recharge. When combined with the different scenarios presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios, the range of results shows major uncertainties in the prediction of future runoff patterns. A risk-based approach that uses a wide range of scenarios is needed and must be systematically used in hydrological assessments.\r"

    "question": " What requirements should be considered when developing communitybased climate change response programs to ensure progressive buildup of resilience without causing maladaptation How can water development projects be screened to maintain a clear focus on enhancing resilience What perspective is necessary when designing development policies to account for potential climate change impacts",
    "answer": "Bottom-up approaches give the opportunity to address vulnerable populations’ needs for resilience and development. By acknowledging that resilience is closely linked to a population’s state of development, level of economic diversification and the strength of their livelihoods assets, community-based climate change response programmes offer the opportunity to progressively build a capacity to reduce climate changerelated risks. Most of the options that will be considered on the basis of bottom-up approaches will not differ from classical agricultural development options for reducing poverty and increasing the standard of living of rural populations. The challenge in this case is to avoid maladaptation (i.e. designing development actions that are excessively sensitive to climate change and will therefore increase the vulnerability of beneficiaries). The concept of ‘climate-proof’ investments is central to the design of programmes for reducing climate change-related risks. It will become necessary to maintain a clear perspective on resilience when screening water development programmes. When designing development policies it will be necessary to systematically consider how the policies may be affected by climate change (OECD, 2009).\r"

    "question": " What specific actions or investments can be taken at various scales  on fields and farms in irrigation schemes within watersheds or aquifers and at the national level  to effectively address climate change in agriculture involving improvements or adaptations in management policies institutions and capacity development Note Table 32 provides examples of these response options",
    "answer": "Options for adaptation to climate change will necessarily combine investments, improved or adaptive management, and modifications in or development of policies, institutions and capacity development. Such options will need to be applied at different scales: on fields and farms; in irrigation schemes (particularly in large schemes); in watersheds or aquifers; in river basins (including transboundary river basins); and at the national level. Table 3.2 lists typical response options and indicates their relevance for different scales.\r"

    "question": " What specific actions should be taken to improve water management at the watershed aquifer and river basin levels in response to water scarcity and climate variability going beyond typical onfarm conservation methods How do these actions differ from development programs with a focus on climate change adaptation",
    "answer": "Most of these options are not new to development programmes. Options for on-farm water conservation have been promoted for a long time as a response to water scarcity and climate variability. Options to address increasing water scarcity through better co-management of water at the watershed, aquifer and river basin level are needed in many water-stressed areas. Although there are overlaps between climate change adaptation and development, activities with an explicit focus on adaptation and climate change will also be required.\r"

    "question": " What types of adaptation activities can be classified into which categories development building response capacity managing climate risk and confronting climate change Please provide specific examples for each category1 Which activities aim at fostering human development and reducing poverty regardless of the cause2 How do activities in the second category building response capacity differ from those in the first and third categories Provide examples3 What are the key elements of managing climate risk in the context of adaptation activities Give instances of such activities4 In what ways do activities in the fourth category confronting climate change differ from those in the other three categories Please describe with reallife scenarios",
    "answer": "Adaptation activities that span the continuum from development to climate change can be organized in four categories. The first category includes activities that are fundamentally about fostering human development. These activities focus on reducing poverty and addressing factors that make people vulnerable to harm, regardless of the cause. The second category of activities focuses on building response capacity. Mostly of a capacity-building nature, these activities tend to involve institution-building and technological approaches adapted from development efforts. The third category involves activities to manage climate risk. Activities in this category focus specifically on hazards and impacts and follow the concept of climate risk management. The fourth category involves activities for confronting climate change. They focus almost exclusively on addressing climate change impacts. Activities in this category tend to target climate change-related risks that are beyond historic climate variability.\r"

    "question": " What measures can be implemented to enhance farmers access to water and optimize irrigation practices reducing uncertainty and promoting efficient use of water and energy resources How can economic incentives such as subsidies for pumping be designed to encourage responsible water usage and minimize wastage",
    "answer": "Increasing the reliability and flexibility of access to water for farmers is of prime importance. Many wasteful behaviours on farms are linked to the uncertainty associated with water distribution practices that do not allow farmers to optimize water application or raise the productivity of their crops. Water storage, and the combined use of groundwater and canal irrigation water, can go a long way towards improving the productivity of water used for irrigation. Economic incentives, in particular the use of subsidies for pumping, must be designed in a way that promotes the efficient use of water and avoids wastage of both energy and water resources.\r"

    "question": " How can farmers increase their resilience to climate variability through actions related to water management on their farms What specific practices can they implement to enhance the capacity to store and access water during variable rainfall conditions Can you provide examples of onfarm water harvesting techniques methods for improving soil moisture retention and ways to facilitate infiltration and groundwater access Additionally how does strategic irrigation during critical periods impact crop losses and productivity",
    "answer": "From a livelihood perspective, building resilience involves reducing farmers’ exposure or sensitivity to shocks, or increasing their capacity to respond. Of prime importance is the ability to increase the farming systems’ buffering capacity in the face of more variable supplies of rainwater. This necessitates an increased capacity to store water in the soil, in surface reservoirs or in underground reservoirs. Any action that increases the capacity to access water when needed will increase resilience to climate variability. These actions include: on-farm water harvesting; the enhancement the soil’s capacity to hold moisture; on-farm water retention and enhanced infiltration; and, where possible, more systematic access to groundwater. Supplementary irrigation at critical periods of the cropping season can reduce losses and boost productivity.\r"

    "question": " How should integrated water resources management be approached in river basins where increased water use and extreme events heighten interdependency among communities and climate change may lead to water scarcity requiring consideration of both supply enhancement and demand management options What role does improved governance of land and water use play in accommodating multiple uses of water for agriculture such as livestock and fisheries",
    "answer": "Integrated water resources management in river basins will become more and more important as the combination of increased water use and the occurrence of extreme events will increase the interdependency of people and communities living in river basins, and as actions in one part of a basin will have repercussions for people further downstream. In places where climate change contributes to increased water scarcity, the whole package of supply enhancement and demand management options will need to be considered (FAO, 2012). Improved governance of land and water use will be required to accommodate the multiple uses of water, including for livestock and fish.\r"

    "question": " What type of insurance specifically requires an agreed threshold to be exceeded by a defined index in order for compensation to be paid to the insured and under what circumstances does this type of insurance show promise for application in developing countries",
    "answer": "A type of insurance which has recently been applied in developing countries is known as index-based insurance. In index-based products, compensation is paid to the insured if the agreed threshold of an index is exceeded. The indices must be defined in such a way that they bear a direct relationship with the performance of the product insured. Index-based insurance is difficult to apply to small-scale hazards but seems to have good potential for hazards with regional impacts like hurricanes or droughts.\r"

    "question": " How can the assessment of waterrelated adaptation options ensure alignment with the concerns and priorities of rural populations according to Sullivan et al 2008 Which dimensions of rural livelihoods related to water should be considered for this purpose",
    "answer": "The adoption of a livelihood approach to water-related adaptation is a useful way to ensure that proposed actions will be beneficial to the people they are supposed to serve. Sullivan et al. (2008) consider four key dimensions of the water-related conditions of rural livelihoods: access to basic water services; crop and livestock water security; clean and healthy water environment; and secure and equitable water entitlement. Using such entry points to screen the impact of adaptation options ensures that they will be assessed in ways that are in line with the concerns and priorities of rural populations.\r"

    "question": " What percentage of the global agricultural area is dedicated to irrigated farming and how does the use of inorganic fertilizers and agrochemicals compare between irrigated and rainfed systems In which agriculture sectors are initiatives to decrease greenhouse gas emissions expected to yield the most significant results",
    "answer": "Irrigated agriculture accounts for only 20 percent of the area of global agriculture, but is more intensively managed. On average, irrigated agriculture uses greater amounts of inorganic fertilizer and other agrochemicals than most rainfed systems. Consequently, efforts to reduce greenhouse gases through improved crop management practices are likely to have more impact in irrigated lands than in rainfed areas.\r"
